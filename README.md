# RandomShapes-sfml-cpp
<h6>Hi! welcome to this DIY activity<h6>
<p>As I continue learning C++ and exploring graphics with the SFML API to better understand these concepts in a fun and engaging way, I created this mini DIY project. In it, I demonstrate how to use the C++ 'random' library along with SFML to create a simple program that displays random shapes at random positions, with random colors and sizes.</p>
<p>Check out the video for a quick tutorial and to see what I’ve created! I’d love to hear your suggestions and feedback!</p>
